Cyber.SoHo Course Catalog

<!-- Replace with actual banner if available -->

Welcome to the official repository for the Cyber.SoHo Educational Framework. This project hosts an interactive, single-page application (SPA) designed to serve as a comprehensive catalog for specialized non-credited college courses.

The curriculum bridges the gap between modern IT, Cybersecurity, DevOps, Artificial Intelligence, and Logistics, offering practical, industry-relevant training for students and professionals globally.

🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Cyber.SoHo course portal. The main entry point is index.html, a dynamic and responsive web application that visualizes the course offerings and provides direct access to curriculum materials.

Key Features

Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes the distribution of courses across different domains (Core IT, Cyber, DevOps, etc.) using Chart.js.

Dynamic Course Grid: A JavaScript-driven catalog that allows for easy updates and scalability.

Curriculum Path Visualizer: An interactive tree diagram that maps out the learning paths for each specialization.

Smart Navigation: Status indicators ("Available" vs. "Coming Soon") and direct linking to course materials.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.

📂 Repository Structure

The file structure is designed to be flat and dependency-free for easy hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages).
